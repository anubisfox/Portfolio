        <h2>About Dylan</h2>
        <div>
          <p>I first went to college with the intentions to become a doctor. I realized after two years of college that was not the path for me. I left college and started bartending while I contemplated what I wanted my career path to be.</p>
          <p>My dad had always talked about me becoming a software developer like he is. I finally realized with my love for computers and tinkering with videogames that it could be the right path for me.</p>
          <p>So I began my journey at Thinkful!</p>
